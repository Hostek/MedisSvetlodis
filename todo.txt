----------- START MEDISSVETLODIS ----------

replace .env logic; instead of doing it by hand add env.py script that would do this automatically.

TODO-FAST:

E2E

-> friends with new activity at top

-> alert user about new msg
  
-> if friendship already exists auto-delete friend request..

-> number of pending friend requests

-> reuse code for banning user

–––FRIEND–REQUEST–TOKEN–––––  
Hybrid Approach:
–> add limit of how many tokens may regenated per day

–> Allow users to toggle between public (searchable by name, unique id) and private (ID-only) modes.

–> Warn users to treat their ID like a password (avoid public sharing).
–> Provide clear instructions for securely sharing IDs (e.g., via encrypted messaging).

–>Integrate with phone contacts/social platforms for users who prefer convenience.

-> add rate limiting everywhere (almost)

9. live chat with websockets
-> apka do randkowania
-> zoom <- (online classroom ? ) maybe combined with livechat?
-> discord clone (NoTREEshTalk ; SencheroAlbero ; MedisSvetlodis -> make site in green colors, with glowing !! (tagline: Where ancient bark hums with tomorrow’s light.) )
-> try to make voice chat the way it's done in telegram
-> can login with qr code from mobile app
-> automatic logout of inactive sessions

Custom mobile app (as it is not supported to server-side rendering)

-----

handle internationalization (multiple languages – probably not gonna do this, because reasons😉️, but no like for real – in organizator it is already implemented so, yea, i don't think it is needed here (of course for full app implementation i'd like to have multiple language support, but u know it's just some side project))
